                <h2>First introduction to IT</h2>
                <p>I was around 17 years old when I was introduced to programming with my IT teacher showing me HTML, what I did well. At that time, I was studying accountancy and thought programming was only for geniuses.</p>
                <p>Over time, I realized that programming is just a skill, not a gift from birth and if I study hard, I will become the one I used to admire.</p>

                <h2>Accountant turned developer</h2>
                <p>I'm always looking for learning new skills, technologies and also improving the skills that I already know. </p>
                <p>Accounting could not satisfy my desire for new knowledge and skills, so I moved into an amazing industry of IT, where my desire will be satisfied.</p>

                <h2>Why developer?</h2>
                <p>There are a huge number of professions in the IT industry, whether they are QAs, HRs, sales managers, but I love creating and changing ideas into reality using a computer or with my own hands(related to hobbies).</p>
                <p>My admiration for programming and ambition have led me down the road of developing and designing web applications.</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>Since January 2022 I have been studying at <a href="https://edu-canshecode.thinkific.com">Can She Code Inc. School</a>. I’ve been invested in my continuous learning process. Currently I'm getting to know the <b>React ecosystem</b>, including Redux and Node.js and this is not the end &#x1F609;.</p>
                <p>I'm currently build websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other frameworks and libraries. I spend most days learning and building up it from scratch. Being passionate, diligent and result oriented, I always work towards achieving best result on each project I lay my hands on.
                I love building responsive user-friendly websites that look visually appealing, with nice and fluid interactions.</p>
                <p>When problems arise, I seek ways to fix them. Whether it takes reading a book, watching Youtube or picking up a lesson in a new framework, I’ve always been eager to solve the challenges that development can bring.</p>
                <p>Overall I hope to further my abilities as a Full-Stack Developer by striving for growth, both in the workplace and as an individual.</p>
